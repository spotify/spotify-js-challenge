![Spotify Logo](../resources/spotify-logo.png)

Refactor a fragment of code.

**Points: 2**

Given a fragment of javascript code, that doesn’t follow proper coding practices: [spotify-entities.js](./spotify-entities.js)

* Refactor and improve the unit tests on the functionality.
* Refactor the actual functionality it to have a more proper structure.
* **Note:** You can use your preferred unit testing FW, replacing the current example.
